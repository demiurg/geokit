# Geokit

The Geospatial Decision Support Toolkit is an open source web based application
that allows stakeholders and customers to build on-line geospatial decision
support tools (DSTs) utilizing custom data sets derived from NASA remote sensing
and other sources. The mission of Geokit is to reduce and eventually remove
technical barriers that limit direct stakeholder control over the creation and
management of geospatially enabled web applications. Geokit is composed of two
loosely coupled components: (1) a geospatial-data enabled web content management
system (the "Site Builder") and (2) an independent service API for processing
requests involving data asset resources (e.g. remote sensing granules from
NASA). These components can be used independently and are provided in two
separate repositories. See more information at www.geokit.io
